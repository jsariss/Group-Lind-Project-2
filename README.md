# Group-Lind-Project-2
Mediterranean Diets and the Minimum Cost Problem

Hello! We are Group Lind and our focus is the sustainability of maintaining a mediterranean diet given regional variability between our two locations in California; Berkeley and a community in Fresno. We use Athens, Greece as a reference for a Mediterraneane location. We hope you enjoy our project!
